# CSV Utils Architecture

## Overview

CSV Utils is a Ruby library designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for CSV file manipulation. The architecture follows a modular design pattern, with each component handling a specific aspect of CSV processing.

## Core Components

### 1. CSVCompare
- **Purpose**: Compares two CSV files to identify differences
- **Key Features**:
  - Identifies creates, updates, and deletes between files
  - Supports custom comparison logic
  - Handles BOM (Byte Order Mark) stripping
  - Memory-efficient streaming comparison
- **Dependencies**: None (uses standard Ruby CSV library)

### 2. CSVTransformer
- **Purpose**: Transforms CSV data according to custom rules
- **Key Features**:
  - Row-by-row transformation
  - Custom transformation blocks
  - Maintains header structure
- **Dependencies**: None

### 3. CSVSort
- **Purpose**: Sorts CSV files based on specified columns
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-column sorting
  - Memory-efficient sorting
  - Preserves header row
- **Dependencies**: None

### 4. CSVReport
- **Purpose**: Generates reports from CSV data
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom report formatting
  - Data aggregation
  - Summary statistics
- **Dependencies**: None

### 5. CSVIterator
- **Purpose**: Provides efficient iteration over CSV files
- **Key Features**:
  - Memory-efficient streaming
  - Custom iteration blocks
  - Header handling
- **Dependencies**: None

### 6. CSVExtender
- **Purpose**: Extends CSV files with additional data
- **Key Features**:
  - Column addition
  - Data enrichment
  - Custom extension logic
- **Dependencies**: None

### 7. CSVWrapper
- **Purpose**: Provides a convenient wrapper for CSV operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplified CSV access
  - Common operation shortcuts
  - Error handling
- **Dependencies**: None

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained and focused on a single responsibility
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Components are designed to handle large files through streaming
3. **Extensibility**: Custom logic can be injected through blocks and callbacks
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation
5. **Performance**: Optimized for large file processing

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Files are read using Ruby's CSV library
   - BOM stripping is handled automatically
   - Headers are preserved and validated

2. **Processing**:
   - Each component processes data in a streaming fashion
   - Custom logic can be injected at various points
   - Memory usage is optimized for large files

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Results are written to new files or returned as data structures
   - Headers are preserved in output files
   - Error states are properly handled

## Error Handling

- File not found errors
- Invalid CSV format
- Missing required columns
- Permission issues
- Memory constraints

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Streaming processing for large files
   - Minimal in-memory data storage
   - Efficient data structures

2. **Processing Speed**:
   - Optimized comparison algorithms
   - Efficient sorting mechanisms
   - Minimal file I/O operations

## Future Considerations

1. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Parallel processing support
   - Additional data format support
   - Enhanced reporting capabilities
   - Caching mechanisms

2. **Scalability**:
   - Support for distributed processing
   - Cloud storage integration
   - Batch processing capabilities

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Individual component testing
   - Edge case coverage
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Component interaction testing
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Error scenario coverage
